            <p class="copy">Imani dreaded going into work every morning. Her manager, Savannah, has shifted her focus from Imani's performance to her appearance and personal life. Savannah gives her compliments all the time and often asks if she has a girlfriend (or if she’d like to have a girlfriend).</p>

            <p class="copy">Savannah has repeatedly asked Imani out on dates and even bought her a gift card for a popular lingerie store for her birthday. Imani does what she can to politely decline and avoid Savannah's attention, but the sexual innuendo and intense staring has become exhausting and upsetting.</p>

            <p class="copy">Imani is uncomfortable at work and uncomfortable talking to her manager directly. She'd like to say something to HR but she doesn’t have any real proof...no one has really witnessed Savannah's advances, and she’s never actually been physical with her…</p>
