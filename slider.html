            <p class="copy">Imani dreaded going into work every morning. Her manager, Savannah, has shifted her focus from Imani's performance to her appearance and personal life. Savannah gives her compliments all the time and often asks if she has a girlfriend (or if she’d like to have a girlfriend).</p>

            <p class="copy">Savannah has repeatedly asked Imani out on dates and even bought her a gift card for a popular lingerie store for her birthday. Imani does what she can to politely decline and avoid Savannah's attention, but the sexual innuendo and intense staring has become exhausting and upsetting.</p>

            <h3 class="status-bar__title">incorrect<h3>
          </div>
          <p class="modal__copy">A common misconception is that sexual harassment requires physical touching. Sexual harassment does not need to be physical to be considered problematic or unlawful. Sexual harassment includes “unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.”</p>

            <h3 class="status-bar__title">there's a better option<h3>
          </div>
          <p class="modal__copy">Maybe, but there might be a better answer. Sure, the direct approach might be advisable in certain circumstances, however, it might be hard to confront the source of the harassment. Remember, sexual harassment does not need to be physical to be considered problematic or unlawful.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="modal__copy">Exactly. Wanting to avoid an uncomfortable conversation is understandable. Imani may find it might be hard to confront the source of her harassment. Given this context, it may be best for heri to try speaking to HR first. Remember: Sexual harassment does not need to be physical to be considered problematic or unlawful.</p>
